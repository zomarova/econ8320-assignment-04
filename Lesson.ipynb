    "## What is programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem like a weird place to start a conversation about debugging code, but it is important to get a bit philosophical about code before we get too far into the process of writing code. At this point, we know enough to start the conversation. Coding really isn't what we think it is. It's much simpler (and yet more complex) than we realize. Conceptually, though, we get to focus on the simple part. Code is a way of formalizing the logical rules for a given process. There is nothing that we can program that a human *couldn't* do. It's just that many of these tasks can be done more quickly by computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of computers:\n",
    "- They don't get sick of paying attention to minute details\n",
    "- They don't care if it takes a long time\n",
    "- They can do computation much more quickly than people\n",
    "- They follow directions exactly\n",
    "\n",
    "Disatvantages of computers:\n",
    "- They follow directions exactly\n",
    "- They can't handle ambuguity without guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, back to programming... what is code for? We write code to provide clear instructions to a computer about how to complete a given task. In other words, programming/coding is just problem solving in a formal context. We use a specific toolkit (in our case, writing Python code), and combine that toolkit with logic to create code. This code then enables our computer to follow instructions to complete a specified process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critically, if our logic is faulty, then our code will inevitably be faulty as well. When writing code, we have to be very careful to think through the rules of logic, and the order in which operations will occur. We know that the computer will follow our directions **literally and exactly**, so that errors in ordering, errors in reference to variables or functions, etc., or simply errors in grammar will cause problems as our computer attempts to follow bad directions.\n"

    "## Factoring Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we solve a problem with code?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we continue to think about the best way to write code, we can consider the patters of behavior and thinking that enable us to facilitate good code writing. One of the most important procedural tools that we can develop is called **Functional Decomposition**. Functional decomposition is also known as **Factoring**. Whatever we call it, factoring is the process through which we break a problem down (decompose it) into its smallest functional elements before we write any code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we break our code down into very small elements, we gain the advantage of being able to see what our code needs to do more clearly. Even better, the smaller we break our code down, the simpler the tasks become, so that we can start to see a pathway from the start of our code, through simple tasks, to the end of our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-life analogy, factoring is equivalent to writing instructions like Lego instructions. When you use the instructions that come with a Lego set, each step is very small, and is described very precisely (through visuals instead of code). Then, as we complete very small tasks (one brick here, one brick there) we eventually arrive at a complete product that tends to be very nuanced, and often has quite exciting functionality, but was built from the same basic pieces as every other Lego set. Our goal is the same. We want to break our project down into very simple steps, then reconstruct those steps one at a time. Eventually, we have reconstructed the end goal, and are able to see that our use of very simple code provides a very exciting solution to a complex problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Factoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into any examples, here are some reasons to factor each program that you write:\n",
    "1. Your code will be easier to read. When you write your code in small pieces, you can comment about the functionality of each piece, and your users will be able to follow along with you as they read your code.\n",
    "2. You will know what you need to do. Factored code takes small steps, so it is much easier to know what next step you need to take as you work through your problem. Once you complete one step on your roadmap, it is time to work on the next piece.\n",
    "3. Your code will be **reusable** to a greater extent. As we will see below, factoring leads us to use many small functions to create larger functions. Because we wrote our code as functions, much of our code will be reusable for similar cases. That means less coding in the future!\n",
    "4. It will be easier to **debug** and run **unit tests**. When we want to test our code, we will be able to do so more easily because we can test each small segment of our code to determine if it functions as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time to Factor!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through a problem and explore how factoring can help us. To date, many of our problems have been relatively small-scale and simple, so factoring will be a much larger benefit as our code gains size and scope than it would have been in many previous assignments. For this lesson, let's use the \"Extra practice\" assignment from last week, and create a class to handle complex numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create your own ``ComplexNumber`` class!\n",
    "1. Complex numbers have a real and an imaginary part. The ``__init__()`` method should therefore accept two numbers. Store the first as self.real and the second as self.imag.\n",
    "2. Implement a ``conjugate()`` method that returns the object's complex conjugate (as a new ``ComplexNumber`` object). Recall that $x = a + bi \\implies \\bar{x} = a - bi$, where $\\bar{x}$ is the complex conjugate of $x$.\n",
    "3. Add the following magic methods to your `ComplexNumber` class:\n",
    " \t- ``__abs__()`` determines the output of the builtin ``abs()`` function (absolute value). Implement ``__abs__()`` so that it returns the magnitude of the complex number. Recall that $|a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n",
    " \t- Implement ``__lt__()`` and ``__gt__()`` so that ``ComplexNumber`` objects can be compared by their magnitudes. That is, $(a + bi) < (c + di)$ if and only if $|a + bi| < |c + di|$, and so on.\n",
    "4. Add the following magic methods to your `ComplexNumber` class:\n",
    "   - Implement ``__eq__()`` and ``__ne__()`` so that two ``ComplexNumber`` objects are equal if and only if they have the same real and imaginary parts.\n",
    " \t-  Implement ``__add__()``, ``__sub__()``, ``__mul__()``, and ``__div__()`` appropriately. Each of these should return a new ``ComplexNumber`` object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this case, our instructions are the first step on the path to functional decomposition (factoring): each point of the instructions describes a different task. We can summarize them, though, to gain a bit more insight into the process of what we need to do:\n",
    "1. Define a class object, and an initialization method\n",
    "2. Define a `conjugate` method following the instructions given\n",
    "3. Define the absolute value of a complex number\n",
    "4. Define less than comparison for complex numbers\n",
    "5. Define greater than comparison for complex numbers\n",
    "6. Define equality for complex numbers\n",
    "7. Define inequality for complex numbers\n",
    "8. Define addition\n",
    "9. Define subtraction\n",
    "10. Define multiplication\n",
    "11. Define division\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, we were able to break our instructions into even finer-grained steps. From here, we can explore the process to complete each of these steps in order to solve our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We just learned this last week! Let's make ourselves a nice simple `class` declaration. Two substeps to this process that we should consider:\n",
    "- The real component of the complex number should be stored as an attribute\n",
    "- The imaginary component of the complex number should also be stored as an attribute\n",

    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging** is, like the name suggests, the process of removing bugs from a program or script. The term has its origins in the physical removal of bugs from giant vaccuum-tube computers in the early/mid 20th century, which makes it kind of memorable. In modern computer science and programming, though, the name refers to the process of removing errors and unintended behavior from our programs. The process of debugging often takes the form of questions like these:\n",
    "- Why do we get the error that we get?\n",
    "- How is data moving through our code?\n",
    "- What needs to be fixed?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will soon see, debugging is a critical part of the programming process. No less important are **unit tests**, although they are less well-known beyond programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Unit Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit Testing** is the process of feeding many different (and possibly wrong) types of information to our code in order to determine how the code will work under less-than-ideal circumstances. For example, what would have happened to our `ComplexNumber` class and its functions if we had passed unexpected information into the class? What if we passed strings as the real and imaginary components? What if we tried to compare a complex number to an integer?\n",
    "- What happens if our input is incorrectly formatted?\n",
    "- What if the data is the wrong **type**?\n",
    "- What if ...\n",
    "\n",
    "As we test our code, we are limited by our ability to imagine the unexpected, but are able to understand how unexpected behavior affects our code. We can then protect our code against that unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Should I Debug and Unit Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debugging** is critical, since our code will not work if it contains bugs. At the very least, it will not work as we expect it to\n",
    "- **Unit Testing** is how we understand where our code fails to prepare for any possible case that could occur\n",
    "\t- We need this if we want to prevent \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\" problems in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging in vanilla Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get started debugging, we can use the debug functionality built into many IDE's (Spyder, PyCharm, and Codio all have built-in debugging functionality based on the core Python debugging libraries). You should use this when you experience an error in a code file in order to explore around the error! Note that the debugger will pause your kernel, and that this will prevent any other code from running on that kernel (kernels are the term for an instance of Python, or the actual process of running Python code) until you exit the debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important commands in the debugger are listed in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Action |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `q` | quit the debugger |\n",
    "| `n` | advance to the next line of code in debugger |\n",
    "| `c` | advance to the next break point in debugger |\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that you can debug no matter where you are, we will simply add breakpoints to our code via the `pdb` library that is part of Python's standard library. Open a new file, and name it whatever you want. In that file, write the line `import pdb`, and then include the code from the previous section for the `ComplexNumber` class.\n",

Then, in an `except` block, I could write code that would use Google Maps to search for the address, collect the city, state, and zip code, and **then** complete the task.
